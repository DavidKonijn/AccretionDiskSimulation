# Accretion Disk Simulations
using `disklab`

The goal of this project was to simulate the accretion disk surrounding different mass black holes. Using the `disklab` package, the radial distribution of the surface density, the temperature, and the total energy of the disk for various theoretical models were simulated and compared to the analytical counterparts. 

## Disks and Accretion Course UvA Computational Project

- Solve the disk conservation equations as a function of radius and time. We start of by checking convergence to a steady state disk, in absence of viscosity variations. 
- Create mock spectra of the disks from part 1 and see how they change upon varying the parameters.
